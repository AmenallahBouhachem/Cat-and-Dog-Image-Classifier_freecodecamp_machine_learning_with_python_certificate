Cat and Dog Classifier
This project is a machine learning model that can classify images as either a cat or a dog. It uses a convolutional neural network (CNN) to analyze the features in the images and make predictions.

Getting Started
To run the model, you will need to download the dataset of cat and dog images and install the necessary libraries. Once you have everything set up, you can train the model and test it on new images.
